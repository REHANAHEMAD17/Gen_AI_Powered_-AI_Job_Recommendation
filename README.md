🧠 Overview 

The GenAI Job Recommendation System utilizes a hybrid approach combining semantic understanding, resume intelligence, and generative summarization to deliver contextually relevant job suggestions on Linkedin and Naukari Platforms.
Unlike conventional keyword-based systems, this platform leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) for deep profile comprehension and embedding similarity to match candidates with optimal roles.

Objectives:

Automate and personalize job recommendations.

Enhance recruitment job efficiency through AI-driven candidate profiling.

Offer dynamic, explainable, and adaptive career insights.
